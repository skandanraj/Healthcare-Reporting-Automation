# 📊 Dropout Consultation Report Automation

## 🧠 Overview

This script automates the generation and distribution of a daily **Dropout Consultation Report**.

The report identifies patients who:

- Had an appointment status of **Cancelled**
- Belong to selected hospitals
- Had appointment date = **Yesterday**
- (Optional) Have "Consider Patient" marked as **Yes**

After filtering, the script:

1. Generates a clean Excel report
2. Sends it automatically via Outlook SMTP
3. Emails it to configured stakeholders

---

## ⚙️ Business Logic

The script applies the following filters:

### 1️⃣ Appointment Status Filter
Only records where:
```
Appt. Status = "cancelled"
```

### 2️⃣ Date Filter
Only records where:
```
Appointment Date = Yesterday
```

The script dynamically calculates yesterday’s date:
```python
datetime.today().date() - timedelta(days=1)
```

### 3️⃣ Hospital Filter
Only records where:
```
Hospital Name is in allowed_hospitals list
```

### 4️⃣ Optional Filter
If column exists:
```
Consider Patient = "Yes"
```
